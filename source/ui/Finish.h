// The unit's finish: the original pearl white with black keys, or pearl
// white or pearl black with neon keys and knobs (pink to red to orange). Only the unit itself changes (its chassis, the expression
// pedal's plate, the lettering printed on it, its keys and knobs); the
// screens, the neon and the dark panels round it stay as they are.
//
// It's a preference of the person, not part of a project or a rig: kept in a
// small settings file in the user's application data folder, so every
// PR7-S opened afterwards, in any project, uses the same finish. Every open
// window repaints when it changes.
